# AIDI1002-Final-Project

## Project Description
In this project we have implemented the methodologies used in "Stock Market Prediction Using Support Vector Regressor with Radial Basis Function Kernel" research paper and tryed to improve the results using different model and latest data. The paper showcases the use of Support Vector Regressor method on data from Indonesia Stock Exchange, we have replecated the code and added a new model Long short-term memory (LSTM) model on recent data because the data used in the research is from 2010 till 2020.
